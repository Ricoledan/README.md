### Hey I'm Ricardo 👋🏾

I'm a Full Stack Developer working on projects revolving around Deno, TypeScript, Node.js, Blockchain and most recently, solutions in the Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence space. I have a penchant for attacking challenging problems, and I love to learn new things. In my free time, I enjoy competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. I'm an avid JRPG gamer and part-time farmer.
